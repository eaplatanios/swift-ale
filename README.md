**WARNING: This is work-in-progress.**

## Prerequisites

`ArcadeLearningEnvironment` depends on the native ALE
library and on [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) which is used
for rendering. The native ALE library can be installed by
executing the following commands in a temporary working
directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment.git
cd Arcade-Learning-Environment
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
make install
```

GLFW can be installed by executing the following commands:

```bash
# For MacOS:
brew install --HEAD git glfw3

# For Linux:
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libglfw3
```

After having installed these libraries you should be able
to use this library.

**NOTE:** The Swift Package Manager uses `pkg-config` to 
locate the installed libraries and so you need to make sure
that `pkg-config` is configured correctly. That may require
you to set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
correctly.

**NOTE:** If the rendered image does not update according 
to the specified frames per second value and you are using 
MacOS 10.14, you should update to 10.14.4 because there is 
a bug in previous releases of 10.14 which breaks VSync.

## Supported Games

`ArcadeLearningEnvironment` will attempt to download the
game ROMs if they are not found in the path you provide when
building the emulator. This means you never have to worry
